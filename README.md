1. Divide-and-conquer Algorithms: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm)

Divide-and-conquer approach to sort the list (38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10) in increasing order. Upper half: splitting into sublists; mid: a one-element list is trivially sorted; lower half: composing sorted sublists.
